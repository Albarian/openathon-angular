# Task 02 - Animations

Animations are a main topic of the UX . Nowadays they aren't a superfluous feature and they are used to guide the user through our app, enhance the user experience, call attention to focus in some feature...

We will introduce the basic management o the animations in Angular because this is a feature that Angular manage internally. To animate efficiently in Angular you have to learn the "Angular way to animate".

Our task will consist of animating the title that appears in some views at the top left when the user enter to these views. Something like this:

<video src="./resources/task02_mini.mp4" width="420"></video>
