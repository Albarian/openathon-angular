# Lab 0.5 - Solid Practises, Code Quality and Angular tools

What’s the meaning of code quality and what the *react-hell* are good practices?

Why can’t I start directly copying and pasting code from Stack Overflow?

**Code is my life, forget anything else!**
</p>
<br/>

If you think this way, imagine the next scenario:

> We want to sell a web page to a client for a price. After some information exchange we tell the client the range of possible prices before entering into the details for a better estimation.

> Some time later, the client tells us that the son of a neighbor can do the same for half the price. We offer our advice against it not because of losing a business opportunity but because the neighbor’s son typical endings… but in the end, nothing can be done and that is.

<br/>

Imagine now the most typical result…
<br/>
<details>
 <summary>You'll Never Believe the Result, click here to know it! (click-bait)</summary>
<p align="center">

> Yes, the result is the client getting something unusable.
> **And I'm not joking. I was a neighbor’s son.**
</p>
  </details>
<br/>

Client gets something that is not fulfilling the expectations at all, in most of the cases not even finished… forget about that son pain trying to create something complex with the simplified and limited point of view of a coder *(I’m not talking about a developer that are things completely different)…* and don’t talk about **reusability, security, extensibility, robustness, reliability, resilientness…**
<br/>

> Sure! Nice and funny names that **smoke-sellers** use freely to try to sell the “same” I can do but far away more expensive - *That’s what I could say 20 years ago.*

## But why now, as an architect I insist on THAT is the key for success
Creating a solution is not a matter of only coding . It requires a lot of **subjects** to consider, **objectives and targets** to be achieved, to think in a lot of candidate technologies that must work together aiming for those targets, deciding with one to use.

Change now the concepts names:
- subjects -> *functionalities*
- objectives and targets -> *requirements*

Only having those concepts clear (functionalities and requirements), technical decisions can be taken with solid foundation. 

So, again: **Don’t start coding. Don’t start with the latest task.**

# What are Solid Practices? 

I know that removing Stack Overflow access will reduce your code skill stats by -20 points, my apologies, but before the urge of hitting keys is too strong…

Because the objective of this Openathon is Angular and not Solid... seguir con esto.

# SOLID DRY KISS
Basic software design principles.

# Code Quality
Main key points for create and maintain good quality code.

# Main Tools
Introduction to the principal tools used real-world projects like: webpack-bundle-analyzer, CompoDoc, Codelyzer, Augury, dependency-check /npm-audit, SonarQube and sonar-scanner.
